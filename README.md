### Building a CGI-Support Multi-Threaded Web Server

**Brief Description:**  
Developed a multi-threaded web server with support for Common Gateway Interface (CGI), designed to handle concurrent HTTP requests and deliver both static and dynamic content efficiently.

**Time Period:**  
May 2024 - June 2024

**Tools:**  
Python, Socket Programming, Threading, HTTP, CGI, HTML, CSS

**Key Achievements:**
- Implemented a multi-threaded architecture that allows the server to handle multiple client requests simultaneously, ensuring high throughput and responsiveness.
- Developed the server to process HTTP GET, POST, and HEAD requests, returning appropriate status codes and content, including 200 (OK), 400 (Bad Request), 403 (Forbidden), and 404 (Not Found).
- Integrated CGI to support dynamic content generation, allowing the server to execute scripts (e.g., Python-based calculations and database queries) and return the results as part of the HTTP response.
- Designed and implemented a thread pool management system to efficiently manage server resources, including handling connection timeouts and maintaining a balance between active threads and incoming requests.
- Conducted performance analysis using tools like `http_load` and `webbench`, optimizing server response time and throughput under varying loads.
